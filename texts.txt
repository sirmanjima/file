If you are using any major operating system you are indirectly interacting to shell. If you are running Ubuntu, Linux Mint or any other Linux distribution, you are interacting to shell every time you use terminal. In this article I will discuss about linux shells and shell scripting so before understanding shell scripting we have to get familiar with following terminologies –

    Kernel
    Shell
    Terminal

        What is Kernel

        The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. It manages following resources of the Linux system –


            File management
            Process management
            I/O management
            Memory management
            Device management etc.
                It is often mistaken that Linus Torvalds has developed Linux OS, but actually he is only responsible for development of Linux kernel.
                Complete Linux system = Kernel + GNU system utilities and libraries + other management scripts + installation scripts.

                What is Shell

                A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.
$ ls
